## Algorithm Explanations

### Simulated Annealing

Simulated annealing is a probabilistic optimization technique inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. The algorithm mimics the way metals cool and anneal, where atoms gradually settle into a more stable, lower-energy configuration.

**How it works:**
1. **Initialization**: Start with a random solution and high temperature
2. **Neighbor Generation**: Create a new solution by making small changes (2-opt swaps in TSP)
3. **Acceptance Criterion**: Accept better solutions always, but also accept worse solutions with a probability that decreases with temperature
4. **Cooling Schedule**: Gradually reduce temperature to focus on exploitation over exploration
5. **Termination**: Stop when temperature is very low or maximum iterations reached

**Key Mathematical Concepts:**
- **Acceptance Probability**: `P(accept) = min(1, exp((current_cost - new_cost) / temperature))`
- **Temperature Schedule**: `T(t) = Tâ‚€ Ã— Î±^t` where Î± is the cooling rate
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: High temperature allows exploration of the solution space, low temperature focuses on local improvements

**Advantages:**
- Can escape local minima through probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions
- Simple to implement and understand
- Works well for many combinatorial optimization problems
- Guaranteed to converge to global optimum under certain conditions

### Quantum Annealing

Quantum annealing extends classical simulated annealing by incorporating quantum mechanical effects, particularly quantum tunneling. This allows the algorithm to "tunnel" through energy barriers that would trap classical algorithms in local minima.

**How it works:**
1. **Quantum Superposition**: The system can exist in multiple states simultaneously
2. **Quantum Tunneling**: Can pass through energy barriers without climbing over them
3. **Enhanced Acceptance**: Uses both classical thermal fluctuations and quantum tunneling effects
4. **Gradual Transition**: Quantum effects are gradually reduced as the algorithm progresses

**Key Mathematical Concepts:**
- **Quantum Acceptance Probability**: `P(accept) = max(classical_prob, quantum_tunneling)`
- **Quantum Tunneling**: `quantum_tunneling = quantum_factor Ã— exp(-Î”E / (T Ã— 0.5))`
- **Quantum Factor Decay**: `quantum_factor(t) = quantum_factorâ‚€ Ã— decay_rate^t`

**Quantum Effects:**
- **Tunneling**: Can escape deep local minima that classical annealing would be trapped in
- **Superposition**: Explores multiple solution paths simultaneously
- **Entanglement**: Correlations between different parts of the solution space

**Advantages over Classical Annealing:**
- Better escape from local minima through quantum tunneling
- More robust to parameter variations
- Often finds better solutions for problems with many local optima
- Theoretical quantum speedup for certain problem classes

### Comparison of Approaches

| Aspect | Simulated Annealing | Quantum Annealing |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Mechanism** | Thermal fluctuations | Thermal + Quantum tunneling |
| **Local Minima** | May get trapped | Better escape via tunneling |
| **Parameter Sensitivity** | Moderate | Lower (more robust) |
| **Computational Cost** | Low | Similar |
| **Solution Quality** | Good | Often better |
| **Theoretical Basis** | Statistical mechanics | Quantum mechanics |

## Quick Start

```python
from src import TSPSolver, TSPDataGenerator, TSPGifGenerator

# Generate TSP instance and solve
generator = TSPDataGenerator(seed=42)
distance_matrix = generator.generate_euclidean_tsp(n_cities=15)
solver = TSPSolver(distance_matrix)

# Solve with evolution tracking
sa_solution = solver.simulated_annealing(track_evolution=True, max_iterations=3000)
qa_solution = solver.quantum_annealing(track_evolution=True, max_iterations=3000)

# Generate videos
gifgen = TSPGifGenerator(distance_matrix)
gifgen.create_evolution_video(sa_solution, 'results/sa_evolution.mp4', fps=5)
gifgen.create_evolution_video(qa_solution, 'results/qa_evolution.mp4', fps=5)
```

## Example Videos

Watch the solution evolution for both algorithms:

### Simulated Annealing Evolution

### Quantum Annealing Evolution

These videos show how each algorithm progressively improves the TSP route. Notice how:
- **Simulated Annealing**: Makes gradual improvements with occasional larger jumps
- **Quantum Annealing**: Shows more dramatic improvements, especially in early iterations, due to quantum tunneling effects
